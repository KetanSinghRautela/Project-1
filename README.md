# Text_Classification
## Introduction 
Classification of Texts, also known as Textbook tracking or Textbook classification, is the process of dividing Textbooks into groups. Using natural language processing (NLP), bibliographers can search for books and prioritize or sort by their content. The potential of informal books is extensive similar to email, social media, websites and many other platforms . However, it can be difficult to extract value from this data unless it is organized in some way. Doing this used to be a small and efficient process, as manually sorting data takes time and money. Textbooks using NLP have proven to be fast, efficient and can be used to model data.
