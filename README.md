# Text_Classification
## Introduction 
Classification of Texts, also known as Textbook tracking or Textbook classification, is the process of dividing Textbooks into groups. Using natural language processing (NLP), bibliographers can search for books and prioritize or sort by their content. The potential of informal books is extensive similar to email, social media, websites and many other platforms . However, it can be difficult to extract value from this data unless it is organized in some way. Doing this used to be a small and efficient process, as manually sorting data takes time and money. Textbooks using NLP have proven to be fast, efficient and can be used to model data. Text classification is often the first step in selecting a dataset for further processing, and perhaps the only step in writing a book like a critical review. Entries in parentheses are not intended to provide information in a textbook that is not an order form. One way to teach the classification of books is to use builtin methods to identify methods for describing data and reuse and reuse these features to choose the order to be used for a particular document. Sentimental analysis is one way of doing that. Areas such as business, product management, education and management already use the process of extracting and analyzing information from data.
### Main Libraries Used for the Code are:

**1. Pandas** - Pandas is an open source Python package widely used for data science/data
analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package called Numpy that
provides support for multiple arrays.

**2.Numpy** - We have names for the target array in Python, but their reuse is slow. Numpy's goal is to provide array objects that are 50x faster than Python lists. Array objects in Numpy are
called ndarrays and provide many support functions that make working with ndarrays very
easy. Arrays are constantly used in data smart works where speed and money really matter.

3.NLTK** - NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit. It is basically a powerful Python
**library that provides tools and resources for manipulating human language data in natural
language processing (NLP). NLTK was developed by the Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Pennsylvania. NLTK provides many functions, including text processing,
token generation, rooting, part of speech tagging, and name association.

**4.Seaborn** - Seaborn is a Matplotlib based data visualization library for Python. It provides maximum links to create beautiful and informative reviews. Seaborn is designed to work seamlessly with the pandas data framework, making it a popular choice for data visualization in data analytics and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
